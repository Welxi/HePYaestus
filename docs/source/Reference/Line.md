## Line
the second high level abstract every experiment will need to create is the line, representing the manufacturing line. this is in control of the world state and is modules learn about the world in which they exist (other than their direct neighbours which may be defined by user or context or router decisions)

when and object needs a resource and does not have a linked router or similar it requests one from the line

this is one way to set experiment default or standard operating procedures.
