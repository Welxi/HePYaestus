# Name (TBD)
Discrete Event Simulation (DES) Python Library for the Manufacturing and Supply line Domains, built on top of [SimPy](https://github.com/simpx/simpy)

SimPy uses Process to model elements in the simulation. These Process are defined in Python by [generator](http://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-generator)Â functions. This Library aims to provide abstractions and tools to aid in the simulation of problems in the Manufacturing and Supply line Domains.

You can find further [documentation](https://hepyaestus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), tutorials and examples can be found here. 

It is encouraged to build on the abstractions provided in the OOP methodology. Class reference documentation can be found

This project relies on many of the GitHub features for collaboration, if can questions cannot be answered by the documentation please feel free to start a discussion or if you encounter a bug please create an issue 
## How to use
A simple single server example

Source: models the receiving of Entities to the System, in this case every time unit
Queue: Buffer before the Machine, in more complex systems provides routing decisions
Machine: Takes an Entity and performs an operation on it for a given time, in this case 2 time units
Exit: The "Output" of the system

>Note on Time
>
>The Library relies on [SimPy time scheduling](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topical_guides/time_and_scheduling.html). It is agnostic to the time scale of the model, what one time unit means in your system is up to you (1 second/minute/hour/etc.)
>
>It is important to note that you keep the same base when inputting values 

```python 
from hepyaestus.Exit import Exit
from hepyaestus.Experiment import Experiment
from hepyaestus.Line import Line
from hepyaestus.Machine import Machine
from hepyaestus.ProbDistribution import FixedDistribution
from hepyaestus.Queue import Queue
from hepyaestus.Source import Source

# Define the timings of Intrest 
arrivalTime = FixedDistribution(mean=1)
processingTime = FixedDistribution(mean=2)

# Create the Nodes of Intrest
source = Source('S', 'Source', interArrivalTime=arrivalTime)
queue = Queue('Q1', 'Queue', capacity=1)
machine = Machine('M1', 'Machine', processingTime=processingTime)
exit = Exit('E', 'Exit')

# Link the Nodes to each other (input/output)
source.defineRouting(successorList=[queue])
queue.defineRouting(
    predecessorList=[source],
    successorList=[machine],
)
machine.defineRouting(
    predecessorList=[queue],
    successorList=[exit],
)
exit.defineRouting(predecessorList=[machine])

# Create the Orchestration Objects
line = Line(objectList=[source, queue, machine, exit])
experiment = Experiment(line=line)

experiment.run(maxSimTime=10)

workingRatio = machine.totalWorkingTime / maxSimTime

print(f'Sim End Time: {experiment.env.now}')
print(f'the system produced {exit.numOfExits} parts')
print(f'the total working ratio of the {machine.name} is {workingRatio:.2%}')
```
## Installation
Currently in Alpha, must clone and install dependencies (in project.toml) from package manager of choice
